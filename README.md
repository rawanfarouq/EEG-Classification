EEG Signal Classification Application

Welcome to the EEG Signal Classification Application repository! This project is the culmination of a Bachelor Thesis from the Media Engineering and Technology Faculty at the German University in Cairo. The aim of this project is to develop an advanced EEG application for improved signal classification, focusing on emotion identification, seizure detection, and movement tracking.

Overview

The project utilizes advanced preprocessing approaches and robust feature extraction methods, such as Common Spatial Patterns and statistical analysis, to enhance data quality and signal representation. Machine learning techniques, including SVM, RandomForest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and CNN, are employed for data analysis. The findings are presented on a user-friendly web platform, providing an interactive interface for users to upload EEG data files, select parts of the dataset, and receive instant predictions of cognitive or physiological states.

Features

1.Preprocessing and feature extraction using Common Spatial Patterns and statistical analysis
2.Machine learning models for EEG signal classification
3.Flask-based web platform for data visualization and user interaction

Usage

Once the project is set up, you can run the Flask web application to upload EEG data files, select parts of the dataset, and receive instant predictions of cognitive or physiological states.

Future Enhancements

The work should be further enriched by building upon the performance of underperforming models and increasing the datasets for better generalization. Additionally, incorporating advanced deep learning techniques can strengthen the capabilities of EEG classification. The web application should also be enhanced to accept and process other common formats of EEG data, such as EDF, for increased flexibility and applicability to a greater number of users and applications.
